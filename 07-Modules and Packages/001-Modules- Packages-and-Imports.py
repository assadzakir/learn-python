# How do you download modules that are not built into Python?
#
# From your terminal or Anaconda command prompt, type:
#
#     conda install *module name*
#
# Because we are using the Anaconda distribution, many modules
# are already included ( specifically scientific computing modules)
#
# if that doesn't work then use:
#
#     pip install *module name*
